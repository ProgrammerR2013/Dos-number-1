# Dos-number-1
Just a normal Dos.

In a Dos, hackers flood a particular webpage, IP Address or whatever they want to, so that they can jam that server.
They do that by sending lots of packets or requests to that server.

This is my first venture into Dos.

I have made this in one day, so feel free to tell me any improvements or report any bugs at my email address:
